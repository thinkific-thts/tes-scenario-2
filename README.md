Take-Home Data Assessment

Welcome! This assessment is designed to evaluate your ability to work with and query a relational database.

Please follow the steps below to complete the test.

Step 1: Clone this Repository

Step 2: Install DB Browser for SQLite

To open and query the .db file, you will need a database browser. We recommend DB Browser for SQLite, which is a free, safe, and open-source tool.

Go to the official download page: https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/

Download and install the correct version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

Step 3: Open the Database

Open the DB Browser for SQLite application you just installed.

Click the "Open Database" button (usually in the top-left).

Navigate to the folder you cloned or unzipped in Step 1.

Select the database file ([assessment_database.db]) and click "Open".

Step 4: Complete the Assessment

You are now ready to begin the test.

Review the Schema: Click the "Database Structure" tab to see all the tables in the database, along with their columns and data types.

Review the Questions: Open the [Questions.md] file (located in the project folder) in any text editor to see the list of questions.

Find the Answers: Go to the "Execute SQL" tab in DB Browser. You can write and run your SQL queries here to find the answers to the questions.

Press the "Execute" (â–¶) button to run your query and see the results in the pane below.
